"How to Read a Book (English, Paperback, Van Doren Charles)",279,Touchstone,426,"9780671212094, 9780671212094",Philosophy and Religion Books,4.3,Van Doren Charles," How to Read a Book by Mortimer Jerome Adler and Charles Van Doren elucidates the many levels of reading, the techniques involved in it and the steps to achieving better comprehension, focus and information from a book. Summary Of The Book How to Read a Book is the quintessential tome that introduces the whole concept of reading. One that teaches comprehension of different genres in reading including science, fiction, poetry and even history, the book has become a rare classic over the years. How to Read a Book tells general readers everything they need to know about reading from elementary and basic reading to a methodical skimming to inspectional reading to browsing or reading with speed. The reader will know exactly what it is to pigeonhole a text, X-ray a book, gather the author's general message and finally even criticise the book. It also covers the various techniques of reading for an assortment of books ranging from imaginative books, practical literature, poetry, plays, science and mathematics, history, social science and philosophy. How to Read a Book is essentially divided into four parts. The first section called the Activity of Reading explains whom a book targets and what the many classes of reading are. This section presents an argument about reading great books and also an explanation regarding the intention of writing this book. The second part is about The Third Level of Reading which is known as Analytical Reading. Here, the authors explain the methodology that goes into reading non-fiction. The book classifies the approaches to reading into three sections -- interpretative, critical and structural. The explanation to these is in part three of the book and is called the ‘Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter’. The focus is on dealing with approaches to reading fiction and poetry. This part also throws light on the method of approaching good books with many examples. The fourth part of How to Read a Book is titled the Ultimate Goals of Reading and addresses syntopical reading and the benefits of this kind of reading. Originally published in 1940, How to Read a Book, was revised in 1970. Considered one of the most successful guides and the bestselling books on reading comprehension, at the end of book the authors offer a suggested reading list. The book is also accompanied with reading tests where readers can measure their progress in reading skills, speed and comprehension.

"The Black Swan (English, Paperback, Taleb Nassim Nicholas)",449,Penguin Books Ltd,480,"9780141034591, 9780141034591",Philosophy and Religion Books,4.5,Taleb Nassim Nicholas," Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan is a concept that will change the way you look at the world. Black Swans underlie almost everything, from the rise of religions, to events in our own personal lives. A Black Swan is a highly improbable event with three principle characteristics: it is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random and more predictable than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan so was 9/11. And why do we always ignore the phenomenon of Black Swans until after they occur? As Nassim Nicholas Taleb reveals, we are hard-wired not to truly estimate risk, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the ‘impossible’. In this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know, and shows us how to face the world.","results\images\Philosophy and Religion Books\4.1.jpeg, results\images\Philosophy and Religion Books\4.2.jpeg, results\images\Philosophy and Religion Books\4.3.jpeg"

Acclaimed clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson has influenced the modern understanding of personality, and now he has become one of the world's most popular public thinkers, with his lectures on topics from the Bible to romantic relationships to mythology drawing tens of millions of viewers. In an era of unprecedented change and polarizing politics, his frank and refreshing message about the value of individual responsibility and ancient wisdom has resonated around the world. In this book, he provides twelve profound and practical principles for how to live a meaningful life, from setting your house in order before criticising others to comparing yourself to who you were yesterday, not someone else today. Happiness is a pointless goal, he shows us. Instead we must search for meaning, not for its own sake, but as a defence against the suffering that is intrinsic to our existence. Drawing on vivid examples from the author's clinical practice and personal life, cutting edge psychology and philosophy, and lessons from humanity's oldest myths and stories, 12 Rules for Life offers a deeply rewarding antidote to the chaos in our lives: eternal truths applied to our modern problems.","results\images\Philosophy and Religion Books\6.1.jpeg, results\images\Philosophy and Religion Books\6.2.jpeg, results\images\Philosophy and Religion Books\6.3.jpeg, results\images\Philosophy and Religion Books\6.4.jpeg"
