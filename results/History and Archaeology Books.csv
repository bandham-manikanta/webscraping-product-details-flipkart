"The Argumentative Indian (English, Paperback, FBA Sen Amartya)",449,Penguin Books Ltd,432,"9780141012117, 9780141012117",History and Archaeology Books,4.4,FBA Sen Amartya," The book is a collection of prize-winning essays on public debate and intellectual pluralism in Indian history. Summary Of The Book Basing The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture And Identity in as simple a tradition as Calcutta’s ‘addas’ or a gathering of people at street corners to discuss everything from politics to cricket, Amartya Sen explains that this spirit of discussion is deeply ingrained within the people of India. And it is this healthy expression of opinions, debates and discussions which involves India’s many ethnic groups, opines Sen, that will lead to the success of democracy and the downplaying of India's caste system and inequalities. He goes on to say that this acceptance, personal modification and rejection of another’s views is what makes Indians liberal in contradiction to the general view that it is a product of Western influence. In actuality, he says, Indians have a unique quality where they assimilate ideas from Western culture into their own. Extensive is what one would say about the The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture And Identity, where Sen talks of Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray in his essays and how they are examples of liberal Indias. He openly challenges many widely held beliefs about Indians, like the belief that human rights are inherently Western concepts, and he does so with finesse and with a barrage of examples from old and modern India. He expresses many of his own views while politely arguing with the opinions put forth by influential people worldwide. The fact that he takes his readers through a variety of examples to prove his points is one of the book’s most interesting features. What has to be said about the book is that it breaks away from the usual perceptions that both Westerners and Indian people have and provides readers with a new way of looking at India. About Amartya Sen Amartya Sen is a Nobel prize winning economist and philosopher. Some of his most popular books include Poverty And Famines, On Ethics and Economics, Commodities and Capabilities, On Economic Inequality and Identity and Violence. Sen is greatly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore and Martha Nussbaum among others. His works also have strong philosophical bases. He was quoted saying that many of his economic theories are closely related to philosophical morals. He was born in 1933 in Santiniketan, West Bengal. He studied in Dhaka at St Gregory's School and later studied B.A. at Presidency College. He studied at Trinity College at Cambridge.

"Savarkar (English, Hardcover, Sampath Vikram)",899,Penguin Viking,624,"9780670090303, 0670090301",History and Archaeology Books,4.8,Sampath Vikram,"As the intellectual fountainhead of the ideology of Hindutva, which is in political ascendancy in India today, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar is undoubtedly one of the most contentious political thinkers and leaders of the twentieth century. Accounts of his eventful and stormy life have oscillated from eulogizing hagiographies to disparaging demonization. The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between and has unfortunately never been brought to light. Savarkar and his ideology stood as one of the strongest and most virulent opponents of Gandhi, his pacifist philosophy and the Indian National Congress. An alleged atheist and a staunch rationalist who opposed orthodox Hindu beliefs, encouraged inter-caste marriage and dining, and dismissed cow worship as mere superstition, Savarkar was, arguably, the most vocal political voice for the Hindu community through the entire course of India's freedom struggle. From the heady days of revolution and generating international support for the cause of India's freedom as a law student in London, Savarkar found himself arrested, unfairly tried for sedition, transported and incarcerated at the Cellular Jail, in the Andamans, for over a decade, where he underwent unimaginable torture. From being an optimistic advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity in his treatise on the 1857 War of Independence, what was it that transformed him in the Cellular Jail to a proponent of 'Hindutva', which viewed Muslims with suspicion? Drawing from a vast range of original archival documents across India and abroad, this biography in two parts-the first focusing on the years leading up to his incarceration and eventual release from the Kalapani-puts Savarkar, his life and philosophy in a new perspective and looks at the man with all his achievements and failings.","results\images\History and Archaeology Books\8.1.jpeg, results\images\History and Archaeology Books\8.2.jpeg"
