Acclaimed clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson has influenced the modern understanding of personality, and now he has become one of the world's most popular public thinkers, with his lectures on topics from the Bible to romantic relationships to mythology drawing tens of millions of viewers. In an era of unprecedented change and polarizing politics, his frank and refreshing message about the value of individual responsibility and ancient wisdom has resonated around the world. In this book, he provides twelve profound and practical principles for how to live a meaningful life, from setting your house in order before criticising others to comparing yourself to who you were yesterday, not someone else today. Happiness is a pointless goal, he shows us. Instead we must search for meaning, not for its own sake, but as a defence against the suffering that is intrinsic to our existence. Drawing on vivid examples from the author's clinical practice and personal life, cutting edge psychology and philosophy, and lessons from humanity's oldest myths and stories, 12 Rules for Life offers a deeply rewarding antidote to the chaos in our lives: eternal truths applied to our modern problems.","results\images\Self-Help Books\8.1.jpeg, results\images\Self-Help Books\8.2.jpeg, results\images\Self-Help Books\8.3.jpeg, results\images\Self-Help Books\8.4.jpeg"

Written during the Wreat Depression, against a background of millions of people dispd-ssessed and out of work and an impending world war, Napoleon Hill's magnum opus held out fervent hope and belief that life indeed could get better. A considerable part of the book- is quite simply the values embraced by 20th century American Capitalism: work hard, move ahead by doing quality work, treat your customers with respect, anybody can become rich and/or powerful if they can conquer their personal limitations and weaknesses. The core 'secret' of this book, however, is rather elusive; Hill never gives us a precise formula to acquiring wealth, although he hints that it exists. However, the title of the book is 'Think and Grow Rich,' not 'Get Rich Quick': Hill insists that we analyze our personal strength and weaknesses and grow spiritually, in order to draw fortune our way. This involves developing a high level of self-discipline and making an effort to know oneself. He also incorporates a lot of good, practical business advice: find new opportunities created by technologicalinnovations, make a written plan and stick to it, don't be afraid to fail repeatedly.

"Principles (English, Hardcover, Dalio Ray)",837,Simon & Schuster,592,"9781501124020, 9781501124020",Self-Help Books,4.8,Dalio Ray,"#1 New York Times Bestseller ""Significant...The book is both instructive and surprisingly moving."" -The New York Times Ray Dalio, one of the world's most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he's developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business-and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals. In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater's exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as ""an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency."" It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio-who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood-that he believes are the reason behind his success. In Principles, Dalio shares what he's learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book's hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of ""radical truth"" and ""radical transparency,"" include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating ""baseball cards"" for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they're seeking to achieve. Here, from a man who has been called both ""the Steve Jobs of investing"" and ""the philosopher king of the financial universe"" (CIO magazine), is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you'll find in the conventional business press.","results\images\Self-Help Books\10.1.jpeg, results\images\Self-Help Books\10.2.jpeg, results\images\Self-Help Books\10.3.jpeg, results\images\Self-Help Books\10.4.jpeg"
