The author, a teacher and social worker, has had close interactions with various sections of the society. As a sensitive observer of people and their characteristics, she has been able to bring to this collection a myriad of experiences and emotions that cuts across all barriers of class, religion, and location.

He recalls his relationship quickly enough on his father's death to make sure of his inheritance. A young girl dotes on her little brother, only to be sold by him into prostitution, ironically on Rakhi day. A beggar goes to a region devastated by an earthquake, to pose as a victim and benefit from any relief package that have been designed for those affected by the disaster. Wise And Otherwise : A Salute To Life tells the story of a woman who does not fail,to express her gratitude even while in her death bed. There is the story of a young boy who fishes for crabs and makes a small amount each day, which supports his family. When asked what use that little amount would be to him, he says pragmatically that is better than nothing. A man in a tribal settlement teaches the author that there can be grace and dignity even in the acceptance of gifts, not just in the giving of them. Written in a simple, unadorned language, the author uses these stories to explore and analyse so many vastly different behaviours that cuts across the many sections of society. Ultimately, the book proves that for all, the many differences in language, culture, class and place, human nature is the same everywhere - Capable of the moat base behavior and also capable of supreme acts of selflessness and caring.
